# StarFund_Investment
Analyzing the performance of an Investment Fund against the index SP500. 
The fund is composed of 5 different stocks: META, GOOGLE, AMAZON, NETFLIX, and TESLA.

- The Jupyter Notebook provides a quarter and weekly analysis of the fund and the SPX500.
- The Python Script reads a users.csv file that has the information on the user_id, investment_open_Date, and investment_close_Date. Based on this, if the script is run from the terminal and with a parameter of path_to_folder where you can find the market data files and the users.csv, it outputs a new CSV file with the amounts to refund the users.
